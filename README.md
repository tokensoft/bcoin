# Bcoin

## Changes in this Fork

This fork contains 2 main changes.
- The XPUB keys are allowed to be BIP35 compatible.  This means that it allows level-2, non-hardend XPUBs.  The key generation paths and watching are now BIP35 compatible, however.
- The lookahead is extended for use cases expecting a large number of unused wallets.

## General 
__NOTE__: The latest release of bcoin contains a non-backward compatible change
to the rest API. Please read the [changelog]'s "migrating" section for more
details.
